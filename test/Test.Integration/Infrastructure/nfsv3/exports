# NFS Exports for NFSv3 Integration Testing
#
# /export/rw - Read-write export for write tests (empty)
# /export/ro - Read-only export with pre-seeded test data
#
# Options:
#   rw/ro       - Read-write or read-only access
#   sync        - Synchronous writes (safer for testing)
#   no_subtree_check - Disable subtree checking (better performance)
#   no_root_squash   - Allow root access (needed for tests)
#   insecure    - Allow connections from ports > 1024
